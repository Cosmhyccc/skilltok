  <p>Here's a challenge for you. Read this article without picking up your phone.</p>

  <p>The world today is plagued, not with the excess of something bad. Rather the lack of something good. Something essential.</p>

  <p><strong>Attention.</strong></p>

  <p>How did we get here? It hardly matters. We know social media has done some irreparable damage to our world. It connected us so well, yet pulled us further apart from ourselves. Most of us are struggling to focus on simple tasks, let alone goals. When our goals seem hard to achieve, instead of focusing on a way to achieve them we pick up our phones and scroll through the pages of those we admire. The life we want to live. Sure it brings happiness, comfort even. Next thing you know 3 hours have passed by and you’re still doom scrolling.</p>

  <p>There is simply no end to this poisonous loop. The companies that build this technology will tell you there’s nothing to worry about. And that, “This same thing happened with newspapers and video games”. But this argument fundamentally ignores the relationship of man and machine.</p>

  <p>I, as a technologist, fully embrace innovation and progress. But millions of kids doom scrolling their entire childhood away on TikTok is neither innovation nor progress. In fact, research suggests depression scores increase by 12% and anxiety 15% after just 20 minutes of doom scrolling. Last week YouTube did a keynote boasting the fact that 200&nbsp;billion hours daily are spent on YouTube Shorts. Yes, you read that right. Is this the type of world you want to leave behind? Not me.</p>

  <p>But none of this is news to you. You already know this. Why am I wasting your time.</p>

  <p>More importantly, what am I doing to fix this?</p>

  <p>The short answer. I don’t know. But I am trying.</p>

  <p>I am trying to build a tool that can help the world focus, learn, build and achieve their dreams.</p>

  <p>With the exponential progress in AI, there has been a boom. If you live in the Bay Area you especially see this, but the rest of the world is starting to see it too.</p>

  <p>AI will help us improve the world. It will help us with things we can not even imagine yet.</p>

  <p>My goal is to take a stab at using AI to generate informative content—content tailored to a student using it, whose entire goal is to help that student level up.</p>

  <p>The first version of my app, <strong>SkillTok&nbsp;AI</strong>, is a simple experiment at how we can combine the addictive vertical scroll UX with academics instead of brain-rot social-media content—how we can incentivize the young mind to learn, to be curious.</p>

  <p>An AI that is designed and trained to help the student succeed will burn tokens with that goal in mind.</p>

  <p>So this is the first version of the app. As basic as it gets. And the worst it will ever be.</p>

  <p>I hope you all like it. I hope we can improve the world, one scroll at a time.</p>

  <p>Thank you &lt;3</p>
